# PlayFabMultiplayerServersCLI

A totally unofficial CLI to manage [Azure PlayFab MultiPlayer Servers](https://playfab.com/features/game-services/multiplayer/) written in Go.

Uses

- [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)
- [PlayFab's Multiplayer Server API](https://api.playfab.com/documentation/Multiplayer#MultiplayerServer)
- [A totally unofficial Golang PlayFab API that I wrote](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/playfabsdk-go) (there is an [open Pull Request](https://github.com/PlayFab/SDKGenerator/pull/392) for that on PlayFab's official SDK repo)

Heavy work in progress. No guarantees.
